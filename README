File/Reader version 0.5
========================

File::Reader allow you to simply manipulate your text files. You can easily read and write text file (or sources codes, HTML, XML, etc.).
I personally use very often Write() to generate HTML code.
File::Reader also provided a good interface for reading configuration files.

This current release (0.5) work really fine. The module is not in version 1.0 because I hope to associate many news functions to him (read the TODO file for more information).
