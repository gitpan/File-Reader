File/Reader version 0.8
========================

File::Reader allow you to simply manipulate your text files. You can easily read and write text file (or sources codes, HTML, XML, etc.).
I personally use very often Write() to generate HTML code.
File::Reader also provided a good interface for reading configuration files.

This release contain a new function : generateConfFile()
