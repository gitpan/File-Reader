TODO list for File::Reader

I'm currently working on the 0.6 version of the module. There is 2 functionnalities that I want to implemant in File::Reader

1 - WriteConf* functions wich permit to write your configuration files.
2 - Support of (en|de)cryption with GnuPG for all the functions (I'm slowed down by some security problems like race condition).
